# IBM Redbooks – Establishing a Secure Hybrid Cloud with the IBM PureApplication Family – February 2016

__Authors__: Gregory Scott, Marcelo Manhaes, Angelo Littera, David Graesser, Addison Goering, Chris Clark, Tom Bal, Amit P. Acharya

Publisher: IBM Redbooks
Release Date: February 2016
ISBN: 9780738441252

__Abstract__

This IBM® Redbooks® publication takes you on a hybrid cloud journey with IBM PureApplication® System and PureApplication Service: from the what, over the why, and to the how. We outline the needs for a hybrid PureApplication cloud and we describe how to build a strategy. We provide advice about the components, including security. Through use cases, we define the need and the strategy for a hybrid cloud implementation with IBM PureApplication System, Software, or Service.
The target audience for this book varies from anyone who is interested in learning more about a true hybrid cloud solution from IBM to strategists, IT architects, and IT specialists who want an overview of what is required to build a hybrid cloud with IBM PureApplication family members.

# Patent – Method for configuring a data processing system for fault tolerance – 2004-08-05

__Inventors__: Alfio Fabrizi, Angelo Littera

__Abstract__

A technique for configuring a data processing system for high availability. A set of rules for high availability is defined. A set of target parameters indicative of a target configuration of the data processing system which is highly available, is also defined. A set of existing parameters indicative of a current configuration of the data processing system is automatically collected from the data processing system. The rules with the target parameters are automatically applied to the existing parameters to identify actions to reconfigure the data processing system for high availability. Some of the target parameters identify resources of the data processing system intended to be highly available. Some of the identified actions are automatically implemented.
